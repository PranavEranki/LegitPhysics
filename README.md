# Phynematics

WilHacks project - October 2017

Physics app with takes in values and returns all other values which are derivable - uses an array of functions.
Also has a study tab, with questions and answers.
Also showcases a testing tab to test users' skills.
Finally, also has a tab with a lot of the important equations in physics.

My first hackathon, and it was a very fun experience and eye-opening to the power of code.

Functionality is limited, and not all features were able to be included or working.
